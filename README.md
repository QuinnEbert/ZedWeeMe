ZedWeeMe
========

Synopsis
--------

This is a tinkering experiment with WowWee's RoboMe toy-oriented robotics platform.

Features
--------

Nothing interesting, yet.  Still poking around.

Intentions
----------

+ **Short-term:** figure out reading from and reacting to sensor commands.  Also want to be able to handle weakening battery condition in the toy exoskeleton.
+ **Mid-term:** see if the "mood" calculator can be used for something interesting.  Maybe it can be used as a timer to trigger more roaming behaviour?
+ **Long-term:** hands-on discover turning radii of the exoskeleton.  Want to try to build something allowing it to at least orient itself to the environment.
